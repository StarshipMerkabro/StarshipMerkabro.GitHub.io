          The Starship Merkabro Project will create a Virtual SpaceShip that is intended to bring people from all walks of life together to create a space within space that will be a community of Art
          ,Science ,Sound, Creativity,Healing and all the great things that are born from the synthesis of these things.
          The Starship is for Cyberspace, the Meta Verse, the Universe or Anyverse.
          When this becomes a physical starship the blockchain will show us it all started right here.


Starship Merkabro is a  NFT project that aims to create a dynamic and immersive Space Ship/Virtual  environment where art, music, healing/alignment, and community converge in web3 and the blockchain. 
         The project features a Great Expansive Digital Art Museum on the first level of the virtual ship showcasing a diverse collection of art, digital art ,and music from featured artists or exhibits.

description Starship Merkabro - A Virtual Space Ship/Ark of Art, Music, and Healing in the Metaverse, Universe or Anyverse

Peace and Sonic Greetings Great People of the Universe. 

My name is Shakem Merkabro and I AM building a Starship. The Starship is for cyberspace, the meta verse, the universe or any verse. If/When this becomes a physical starship the blockchain will show us it all started right here with you reading this.
Starship Merkabro is a NFT project that aims to create a dynamic and immersive Space Ship/Virtual environment where art, music, healing/alignment, and community converge in web3 and the blockchain. The project features a Great Expansive Digital Art Museum on the first floor of the virtual ship showcasing a diverse collection of art, digital art , music from featured artists or exhibits.The virtual space ship also features various virtual rooms and atmospheres for meditation, mantra, and sonic healing, as well as a virtual event space for concerts, parties, and conferences.
144 unique Art NFTs will complete the initial phase of collection associated with this project, each with its own sonic signature that will be used for access to the Star Ship and exclusive benefits. Starship Merkabro aims to create a vibrant and interactive community of creatives, artists, healers, and supporters in the web3 environment and beyond.
Introduction:
Starship Merkabro is a NFT project that will explore and materialize the concept of a virtual space within space by creating a dynamic and immersive virtual environment where art, music, healing, and community-building converge. The project aims to provide NFT holders with a unique and interactive experience within the metaverse, fostering a vibrant community of creatives, artists, healers, and enthusiasts. The following outlines the vision, features, benefits, and roadmap of Starship Merkabro.
Vision:
The vision of Starship Merkabro is to create a virtual ark of creativity, art, music, healing, learning, and alignment that transcends traditional boundaries and fosters a dynamic and interactive community within the ‘metaverse’ and greater universe. The project aims to provide a platform for renowned and emerging artists to showcase their digital art. The Starship Merkabro also is a place for
  
 visitors to immerse themselves into plush virtual environments for meditation, mantra, and sonic healing. The virtual spaceship also includes an Event space to host virtual events such as concerts, parties, and conferences. These will be able to be accessed through web3 platforms which also includes mobile, occulus and other VR/AR technology
NFT holders of Starship Merkabro will enjoy exclusive benefits and opportunities to participate in the project's ecosystem by way of private discord. NFT holders will also have Free entry to all virtual rooms, live events and museum exhibitions we plan to have annually once the starship launches. This will bridge the virtual world with the physical world. NFT holders will also receive a portion of proceeds from these said events. The project also aims to create a marketplace for renting out virtual rooms and event spaces while also offering virtual atmospheres and environments for ownership.
ART
Let me not forget my favorite part besides the utility of the project which is The Artwork that comes with this NFT. The artwork is what I call Sonic Art which is a original digital artwork with a Sonic rendition of it which I like to call a Sonic signature. The Sonic signature includes frequencies and sounds unique to the particular artwork. The Sonic signature portion of the art will act as a access card or Sonic password to access certain aspects and benefits of the project. On top of that the artwork can be displayed in frames, digital frames, merchandise or whatever creative use you may have with this digital Art.
Sounds and Atmospheres
With the Starship Merkabro project there will be a large library of sounds, sound effects and specialized atmospheres created and stored in the form of NFTs these will be used within the starship Merkabro ecosystem and some beyond as the web3 and the meta verse continues to expand. These sounds will be tokenized and available for sale and staking so that the NFT owner may generate rewards as these are used.
